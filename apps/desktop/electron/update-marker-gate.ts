/**
 * The update gate's marker probe (R6, SPEC section 6 "Electron gate").
 *
 * A marker whose owner and delegate are dead is not necessarily a finished
 * update: an inheriting completion process can still hold the checkout's
 * kernel lock after the script's immediate child died. The Desktop cannot see
 * that lock portably and must never delete the marker (A7 rule 3), so a
 * dead/malformed marker is routed through the checkout script's `reclaim`
 * helper, which decides under the `<marker>.lock` sidecar:
 *
 * - `held` / `busy` / `live <pid>` => an update still owns the checkout: keep waiting;
 * - `reclaimed` / `absent` => nothing runs: proceed;
 * - no marker at all => the helper is asked too (it checks the checkout lock
 *   under the same rule) unless no checkout lock file exists, which is the
 *   script's own "not held"; only its `held` keeps the gate closed, any other
 *   answer proceeds as before;
 * - `unsupported` (older checkout, no helper) => proceed without deleting
 *   (dead = not running, as before minus the deletion) — unless this process
 *   already saw the same body block: then the script is only missing or
 *   unreadable for a moment (git rewriting it mid-update), so the answer counts
 *   as `error` and is re-asked (review R8 M5).
 *
 * The helper is asked once per distinct dead marker body per wait; a `held` /
 * `busy` / `error` / `live` answer is re-asked every `reprobeMs` (5 s), or on
 * the next poll after a Retry, because only the script can see the lock being
 * released.
 *
 * No positive answer has a ceiling (review R8 D3). `held` means no owner
 * identity is alive but some process still holds the checkout lock; it may be
 * a leaked long-lived one, and it may still be writing the install. `busy` /
 * `error` mean the helper could not establish ownership at all. The one
 * bounded case is a helper that has never answered for this body: after
 * HELPER_ERROR_ATTEMPTS consecutive `error`s (bash / PowerShell blocked, a
 * broken script) the gate proceeds as main did for a dead marker, minus the
 * deletion — otherwise such a machine would park every boot after every
 * crashed update. Once the helper has answered for a body, a later `error` is
 * a transient failure of a working helper (R8 M5) and keeps waiting. Nothing
 * else ever opens the gate by itself: past a short grace the caller shows a blocked
 * boot screen (what holds the install, Retry, Quit) whose only way through
 * while the hold lasts is an explicit, confirmed, logged "Start anyway"
 * (`allowStartOverHold`), scoped to the exact marker body the user saw. The
 * marker is never touched. A helper `live <pid>` names a live identity and is
 * waited out like any live marker (C1 rule 3).
